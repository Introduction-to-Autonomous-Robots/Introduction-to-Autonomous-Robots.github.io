# Notes on Webots

* Webots is available as binary for Windows, Linux and Mac from [www.cyberbotics.com](http://www.cyberbotics.com). You will need to install a python interpreter and setup Webots to use it.
* Follow the instructions in the [Webots Reference Manual](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers) to understand how to use external controllers in order to use Jupyter lab, ipython or other tools with better debugging capabilities.
