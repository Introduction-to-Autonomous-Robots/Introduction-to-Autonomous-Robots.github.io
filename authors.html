Nikolaus Correll, Bradley Hayes, Christoffer Heckman, and Alessandro Roncone are Computer Science professors at the University of Colorado Boulder. They perform research ranging from robotic navigation in challenging environments, to algorithms supporting robots working together with humans, to swarm robotics and smart materials supported by the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Defense, and industry, while teaching undergraduate and graduate classes in robotics.

# Nikolaus Correll

[Correll Lab [LINK]](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/correll/)

The Correll lab is doing active research in robotic manipulation, which is at the intersection of robotic design and artificial intelligence to enable robots with human-like object manipulation skills, and robotic materials, novel composite materials that embed sensing, actuation, computation, and communication.

# Bradley Hayes

[CAIRO Lab [LINK]](http://cairo-lab.com/)

The Collaborative Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Laboratory (CAIRO) focuses on algorithms that enable artificially intelligent agents and robots to safely and effectively collaborate with humans, pushing the boundaries of what is possible through human-machine teaming. With broad applications across manufacturing, disaster response, autonomous vehicles, and space exploration, our research develops novel methods of task planning, motion planning, learning from demonstration, explainable AI, and computational modeling of human behavior.

# Christoffer Heckman

[ARPG [LINK]](https://arpg.github.io)

The Autonomous Robotics and Perception Group studies probabilistic perception algorithms and estimation theory that enable long-term autonomous operation of mobile robotic systems, particularly in unknown environments. We have extensive experience with vision based, real-time localization and mapping systems, and are interested in fundamental understanding of sufficient statistics that can be used to represent the state of the world.

# Alessandro Roncone

[HIRO Group [LINK]](https://hiro-group.ronc.one/)

The Human Interaction and RObotics Group [HIRO] works at the intersection of research in human-robot interaction, artificial intelligence and robot control & planning with the goal of developing robot technologies that enable close, natural, and extended cooperation with humans. In particular, work on: a) robots that are safe to people, b) robots that are capable of operating in complex environments, and c) robots that are good teammates.
