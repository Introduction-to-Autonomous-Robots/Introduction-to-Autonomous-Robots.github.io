# Exercises

We have developed a series of exercises in [Webots](http://cyberbotics.com). This list is constantly growing and can be recombined into different curricula ranging from basic mobile robotics to robotic manipulation classes. 

## Lab 1: Reactive Behaviors and State Machines

{% include image.html url="A.png" max-width="45%" description="I rock"%}
- Basic reactive behaviors such as attraction and avoidance
- How to compose multiple behaviors into more complex ones
- The notion of state and basic ways of implementation

## Lab 2: Line following and odmetery

{% include image.html url="B.png" max-width="45%" %}

- Implement the forward kinematics of a differential wheel robot on the ePuck platform 
- To experience and quantify sensor noise from wheel-slip, discretization, and timing violations 
- To understand the concept of “loop closure”

## Lab 3: Inverse kinematics and feedback control

{% include image.html url="C.png" max-width="45%" %}

- Understand how to calculate the wheel speed given a desired velocity and/or position 
- Implement basic feedback control 
- See the need for higher-level reasoning / path-planning

## Lab 4: Mapping with Lidar

{% include image.html url="D.png" max-width="45%" %}

- Implement a basic discrete map representation
- Use coordinate transforms to map sensor readings into world coordinates
- Understand discrete and algorithmic aspects of mapping

## Lab 5: Path planning

{% include image.html url="E.png" max-width="45%" %}

-	Understand the challenges of map construction
-	Implement a shortest-path finding algorithm (Dijkstra's algorithm or A*) on a grid map
-	Use path planning to generate a discrete set of waypoints for a robot to follow and demonstrate it in the Tiago environment

## Lab 6: Inverse kinematics on an industrial arm
{% include image.html url="F.png" max-width="45%" %}

- Understand the internal representation of kinematics (URDF)
- Use external IK solvers (ikpy) to find IK solutions
- Develop a complex robotic application and draw images from SVG files
