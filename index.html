An open textbook focusing on computational principles of autonomous robots. The source-code is released under Creative Commons 2.0 (CC-BY-NC-ND), whereas the print version is copyrighted by MIT Press. You are therefore permitted to use images and content from the book for non-commercial purposes (including teaching) with proper attribution, but you cannot post compiled versions of the book online.

The book is supplemented by a series of [exerices](exercises.html) in Webots, an opensource, physics-based robot simulator that provides stable binaries for Windows, Linux and Mac, that can be used to develop a series of [curricula](curricula.html). 


# Exercises

We have developed a series of exercises in Webots Exercises can be found in the matrix below. This list is in no particular order, please refer to the [curricula](curricula.html) for a suggested order to cover different classes.
